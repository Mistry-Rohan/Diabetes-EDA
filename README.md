# Diabetes-EDA
This repository contains EDA on Diabetes Dataset. Along with EDA, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Models are applied and compared as well for prediction purpose.

The repository includes the dataset file named "diabetes.csv" and the analysis python file name "rohan_041081134". 

Problem Statement:

One of the widespread health conditions globally is diabetes, with a growing number of individuals affected. The precise origin of diabetes remains unknown, though scientists theorize that a combination of environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and genetic predisposition plays a substantial role in its development.

Several years ago, a study was carried out on American Pima tribe, which are also known as Pima Indians. The study showed that women of this tribe had an early risk of developing diabetes. While preparing the dataset, a number of restrictions were placed on which data is to be selected. Specifically, data chosen was of around the female patients who were atleast 21 years old and descended from Pima Indians.
